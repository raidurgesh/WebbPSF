    Test the pixel scale is changed by the apply_distortion function.

    Create a fake data set that has rows of constant value, so row 0 is all 0s, row 1 is all 1s, etc. Then distort it
    via apply_distortion(), which will change both the pixel scale and skew the data. If there was no skew in the
    data, there'd be a constant x and y pixel scale change, which wouldn't really affect the x direction since the
    function would be blending the same values together, and it would affect the y direction, but by the same amount
    (since again, the function is blending the same values at each index (ie blending 0 and 1 across the entire row).

    So subtract the linear shape caused by the skew out of the row and then check that across a specific row,
    the newly pixel-scale distorted ("blended") values are approximately equal.
