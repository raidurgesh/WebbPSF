Users of WebbPSF are encouraged to cite one of these:

- Perrin 2011, Improved PSF Simulations for JWST: Methods, Algorithms, and Validation, JWST Technical report JWST-STScI-002469

In particular, the 2012 SPIE paper gives a broad overview, the 2014 SPIE paper presents comparisons to instrument
cryotest data, and the Technical Report document describes in more detail the relevant optical physics, explains design
decisions and motivation for WebbPSF’s architecture, and presents extensive validation tests demonstrating consistency
between WebbPSF and other PSF simulation packages used throughout the JWST project.
